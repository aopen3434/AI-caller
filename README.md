1.SIP Call Handling: This is done via pjsua. You'll need your SIP provider details for domain, username, and password.
2.TTS and MP3: The script plays the TTS or MP3 based on the detected audio ("hello" or beep).
3.Speech Detection: Uses SpeechRecognition to listen for "hello" or detect a beep sound in the call audio.
4.Handling Incoming Calls: The script listens for incoming calls and responds with a sales pitch.
Installation:
bash
Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pydub pyttsx3 pjsua
This script covers basic functionality but can be expanded based on the complexity of your needs, 
such as more sophisticated call handling and audio processing. Let me know if you need further adjustments or assistance!

Adding chat GPT to the mix : 

1.ChatGPT Integration:
oThe get_chatgpt_response(prompt) function interacts with the OpenAI API to get responses based on customer input.
oReplace "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" with your OpenAI API key.
2.Listening to Customer:
oThe listen_for_response() function uses a microphone to record customer responses, which are then passed to ChatGPT to generate a response.
oThis helps create a dynamic interaction rather than a static sales pitch.
3.Text-to-Speech (TTS):
oThe speak(text) function uses pyttsx3 to convert the response from ChatGPT to audio, which is then played to the customer.
4.Incoming Call Handling:
oThe incoming call logic is handled in MyAccountCallback, which initiates a conversation and continues it by listening and responding using ChatGPT.
Requirements:
1.Environment:
oMake sure that your Python environment has access to a microphone for capturing input and speakers for audio playback.
oConfigure your SIP credentials correctly.
2.Limitations:
oReal-time Interaction: This script may have latency, as processing audio and getting responses from the API takes time.
oAPI Costs: Using OpenAI's API involves costs per token, so monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges.
3.Security:
oAlways keep your API key safe.
oUse secure methods for storing credentials, such as environment variables.
This script will enable you to handle incoming calls and interact with customers using ChatGPT, providing a more natural and intelligent conversation flow.
